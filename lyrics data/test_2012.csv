Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh)
And I don't even need your love (Oooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Oooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ahhh)
I guess that I don't need that though (Oooh)

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

Losin' it all on my own

But the queen has been overthrown

Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

But I've gotta let it go

Turn away 'cause I need you more

And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh
Oh-ooh-woah-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I'd called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we gave our distance, oh
For the best, you didn't listen

I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down

Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight

I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the up side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now, here you are again
So, let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh, but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell

Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break

Even though we both know that you do, you do

You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up
Well, I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Every day, it'll rain
Rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, ""There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'

We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears

I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?

2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, ""Damn, that makes two of us""
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

This melody was meant for you (Right there)

Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand

Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)

I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

I’m here for one night, how far will you go?

High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)

Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

Those storm clouds gather in her eyes

Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (Blown away)

She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing, even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts and we don’t care 'cause we’re so

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad

Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline

I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up

Want somebody that don't really need you

Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead

Slow pitch, change up

I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile

And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa

Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo

A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile

My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!

It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ugh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (Ugh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (Ugh)
And I was hoping you would— (Ayy)

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, 'cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, ""Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head, like
""What is he doing?"" (Oh) ""What is he doing?""
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me, like, ""I'ma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
Well, my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
Girl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
And then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? (Crazy) We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—
(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up (Oh, yeah)

Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm
Afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything
Take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me

Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight

I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

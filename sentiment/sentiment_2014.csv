I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'

But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him

Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great

But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide

When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one ""for a good time call""
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow, baby

Black, black widow, baby

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

But I wonder, where were you?

Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain

We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

Said, all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleedin'
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

Now, how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every mornin', I just wanna see you starin' back at me (Staring back at me)
'Cause I know that's a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleedin'
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time?

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Ich bin ein hot Boy, so wie Bobby Shmurda

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side

For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you, darling

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

Say it makes you feel like an angel

So girl let's keep burnin' it down

You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you

And light it up like it's our last chance

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss

I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody’s been there
Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out

With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around

8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost

Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doin' fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely, even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them

Just watching her blonde hair, sun burn, stare at them
Whitecaps rolling over
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair
Dropping limes in her Corona
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss
Like ""Honey, I sure want you""
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona

We got 2-for-1s, we're at a margarita bar
Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads
Just sittin' in the corner laughin'
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar
She smiles and shakes it at me

That is my shit
Now throw it up (Man throw that up)
That's what it is (That's what it is)

Can't see me through my tints (Nuh-uh)
I'm riding real slow (Slow motion)
In my paint, wet, drippin', shinin' like my 24s (Umbrella)
I ain't got 24s (Nuh-uh)
But I'm on those Vogues (Yeah)
That's those big white walls, r-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rollin' in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man, I'm loungin'
In some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
Lookin' down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashin'
I'm duckin', buckin' them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge
The same one we'd walk across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school
Candy paint, two-seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And rolled on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer

Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fucking lottery homes

Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know

I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad

Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
(Yeah, yeah, Yeah)

Oh-oh, hey, oh-oh

Baby, baby, yeah, are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Ooh-oh, baby, are you listening?
Oh-oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh-oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity, you and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When he led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
